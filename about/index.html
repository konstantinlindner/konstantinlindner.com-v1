<h1 class="header"><span style="color:#eb3a34">I am</span><br/></h1>
<p>
  An extremely curious, positive and optimistic person with an eye for detail and improvement. I am almost always happy, spirited and ready to go on whatever journey awaits next, seldom you will hear me saying the word 'no'. Some of my biggest strengths are finding areas of improvement, big or small, and seeing the possible solutions to a specific problem. Furthermore, data and statistics are big interests and passions of mine. I love creating Excel-sheets filled to the brim with formulas and charts to visualize important data.<br/><br/>Another equally fundamental part in my life is getting to know and working with people, focusing on building great relationships and real connections. When evaluating a workplace, how well the employees are operating as a team, helping out each other and working together to achieve things are some of my main areas of consideration and attention.</p>
